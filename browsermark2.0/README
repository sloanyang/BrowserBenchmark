[Introduction]
Hugely popular Browsermark is a benchmark tool designed to measure 
browser performance of mobile and embedded devices. 
Browsermark measures a browser¡¯s performance in JavaScript and HTML rendering. 
Browsermark was designed to tell an end-user 
which browser performs the best on their mobile or embedded device. 
It is easy to compare scores by running Browsermark again using a different browser. 
Changing browser to the one that is faster can mean that pages with 
dynamic content will be more responsive.
The sources are local version which we can run tests individually.

[Source Code Directories]
1.index.html 
Entry of the benchmark
2.tests/benchmarks  
Each sub-directory is a test suite. 
Each *.js file in the sub-directory is a test case.
3.images  
Images for browsermark2.0.

[How to make peacekeeper run individual test case]
1.Get related resources by chrome develop tools and wget.
2.Change all the ajax resposes to html files.
3.Change all the absolute path to relative path in all the html and files.
4.Delete unused ajax request in js files.
5.Change benchmark.js in tests folder, submit the results to results.html.
6.Add index.html, results.html and common.js
7.Change test.js in tests folder, submit request to related test page. 

[How to run individual test case]
Open index.html in the browser. For chrome, 
should add '--allow-file-access-from-files' command line argument.

[What factors affect the score?]
Other than the browser itself, the most significant factor affecting 
the score is the type of CPU in your Internet device. 
After that, the power of your graphics chip affects the result somewhat, 
though mostly in situations where the card is very slow, 
or no drivers have been installed for it. 
Running other applications that consume system resources at the same time 
as the benchmark is running will naturally affect the score. 
The size of the viewable browser area also affects the score, 
so the screen resolution you use, the size of the browser window and whether 
the window is minimized affect the score as well. 
Beyond these, other factors are usually not significant. 
Your internet connection speed and network latency 
do not influence the score in any way.
