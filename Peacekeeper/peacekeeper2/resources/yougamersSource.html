			<div class="body"><p>
Hot off the presses, Monolith Productions and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment have announced that their highly anticipated first person shooter, <a href="/games/10306/">F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin</a>, has begun shipping to stores across North America today. Unfamiliar with this bone-chilling series? No worries! Here's a brief description courtesy of the official <a href="/forward?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20090210005682%2Fen" target="_blank">press release</a>:
</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>
F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is a blend of advanced visceral combat mixed with seamless game pacing set inside a sinister and paranormal universe that begins shortly before the ending of F.E.A.R. A Special Forces squad is on a routine mission when the city of Auburn is rocked by a supernatural explosion. Alma, a girl with immense power and a thirst for revenge, has unleashed her wrath upon the city and thrown it into chaos. Tension builds as the squad must combat enemy forces and the supernatural as they struggle to find a way to stop Alma and uncover the mysterious forces arrayed against them before it’s too late.<br>
</p>

<p>
As players move throughout the smoldering remains of Auburn in search of Alma, they must investigate the crumbling remains of schools, hospitals and alleyways as they are stalked by otherworldly creatures and enemies. Gamers will need to use everything at their disposal, including all-new weapons and superhuman abilities, to fight the supernatural forces arrayed against them and keep the entire city from succumbing to Alma.
</p>

<p>
In addition to a gripping single-player campaign, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin supports up to 16 players for action-packed multiplayer match-ups. Multiplayer options include nine maps, four modes and a powerful mix of weapons, grenades and high tech machinery, including the Elite Powered Armor (EPA) mech suits that players can take control of in both multiplayer and single-player action.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Those of you who live in Europe will be able to purchase the game on <b>February 13th</b>. So keep an eye out for it! :)

</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>
<b>Nightfire</b> <br>
In "Nightfire," players take to the streets of a war-ravaged Berlin with only the flames of the burning city to expose the enemy.
</p>

<b>Station</b> <br>
"Station" offers a bombed out underground train station littered with hidden passageways and destroyed subway cars.
</p>

<p>
<b>Knee Deep</b> <br>
"Knee Deep" takes place on the island of Peleliu in a once tranquil village turned chaotic Japanese command center.
</p>

<p>
<b>Verrückt (Zombie Asylum)</b> <br>
The fan favorite 4-player co-op Nazi Zombies Bonus Mode returns with "Verrückt," a terrifying Zombie asylum featuring more weapons, perks via the addition of Perks-a-Cola machines, electroshock defenses and the endless zombie horde.
